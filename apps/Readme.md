## Notes
- **Broad Scope**: An app (application) typically refers to a software program designed to perform a set of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user. Apps have a user interface (UI) and are intended to be directly used by end-users. They can be standalone or part of a larger ecosystem.
- **User-Centric**: Apps are often developed with a specific user experience in mind, whether they are web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, or cloud applications. The focus is on solving user problems and providing functionality through a user interface.
- **Monolithic or Microservices-Based**: Applications can be built as monolithic systems, where all functionalities are under a single codebase, or they can be composed of multiple microservices, each contributing a piece of the appâ€™s overall functionality.
